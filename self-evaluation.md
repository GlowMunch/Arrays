1. How confident do you feel the the content on Arrays so far?
    - I feel good with how I understand them. A littel fuzzy on booleans in arrays. I noticed some need single quotes.
1. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
    - I could know more about methods and will look into the Array Class page suppled in the lesson.
1. What questions do you have about arrays?
    - Is this where we can store and add lists that evolve with our code that we can call back onto? How do we track changes to our array, or make it update live without getting too out of hand.
